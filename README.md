# react-native-rate-modal
"Rate us on Google Play/Play Store" modal with React Native.

## Example usage
![5 Star](https://github.com/omergulen/react-native-rate-modal/blob/master/public/img/5.gif)
![1 Star](https://github.com/omergulen/react-native-rate-modal/blob/master/public/img/1.gif)

You can pass different functions for each star, so you can do as you wish.
1 to 4 stars just Alert -> Thanks, but in 5 star rating you redirect user to the Store or Play.
